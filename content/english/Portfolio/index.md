### but my skills didn't come from nowhere!

### to be accepted by these universities, i had to work hard:

---

- during my middle school (2014 - 2017) at **Colégio Mater Amabilis** i was among the best students, going as far as receiving full-ride thanks to my academic performance in olympiads and exams

<br>

#### i won 35 medals from scientific Olympiads during this period, ranging from **physics to astronomy, math, robotics, and more**

#### this includes **three!** international math Olympiads

###### (shown in the [awards](#awards) section)

<br>

- thanks to these international medals, a headhunter from **Colégio Farias Brito**, one of the best educational institutions in Brazil, invited me to study there

<br>

#### that's how i started living by myself 2954km / 1854mi away from my family **when i was only 15yrs old**

#### the institution gave me a full-ride which included food, clothing, transportation, and even an apartment with other like-minded students!

#### i then started participating in an honors class, focusing in math olympiads
