## as you can see, i'm good at math, physics, computer science...

###### ...or just stem, in general (✿◡‿◡)

---

### but my skills didn't come from nowhere!

### to be accepted by these universities, i had to work hard:

---

- during my middle school (2014 - 2017) at **Colégio Mater Amabilis** i was among the best students, going as far as receiving full-ride thanks to my academic performance in olympiads and exams

<br>

#### i won 35 medals from scientific Olympiads during this period, ranging from **physics to astronomy, math, robotics, and more**

#### this includes **three!** international math Olympiads

###### (shown in the [awards](#awards) section)

<br>

- thanks to these international medals, a headhunter from **Colégio Farias Brito**, one of the best educational institutions in Brazil, invited me to study there

<br>

#### that's how i started living by myself 2954km / 1854mi away from my family **when i was only 15yrs old**

#### the institution gave me a full-ride which included food, clothing, transportation, and even an apartment with other like-minded students!

<br>

- i then started participating in an honors class, focusing in math olympiads. in 2020, i began the process of studying for the SAT / TOEFL exams

<br>

#### my tests were rescheduled several times due to the pandemic. uncertainty was the norm as no one knew what would happen to us, students.

#### nonetheless, **i remained positive**, studying several hours per day. the hard work paid off!

---

### i scored

## **1550 / 1600**

### on the SAT and

## **111 / 120**

### on the TOEFL

---

## of course, **good scores aren't enough.**

### a good profile needs to be well-rounded!

##### leadership

### i've always been a natural leader.

<h2 class="text-end">not because i think i'm better...</h2>

<br>

<h3>(〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)</h3>

<br>

<h2 class="text-start">...but because i think i can bring the best out of others!</h2>

---

- i was one of the three founders of Nery, a medical startup (2020). It all started after we got **2nd place** in the MIT Hackmed Brasil Competition. The prize was used to support the project! I helped as the CTO, using my UI/UX expertise

#### although i was the youngest of the group - by far - i managed to find my role and help my co-founders during the initial steps

<p class="text-end">...unfortunately, we stopped due to COVID issues <b>＞︿＜</b></p>

---

- i am the co-founder of Good Luck Collective as well, a gamedev group (2021)

#### i help with the coding, art, and design of the games

#### i act as the bridge between the programmers and the artists, helping with the development and ensuring the flow isn't interrupted during game projects

#### we've already won a game-jam!

---

- i was the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of Dupla, a headhunting startup (2021). i developed the website (design included!), took care of the marketing, and managed the social media content

#### investors quickly became interested in helping us!

<p class="text-end">this one i left to pursue my own path! it was worth it (✿◡‿◡)</p>

---

- as you know, i also have my personal projects

<br>

## i publish stuff i make on two instagram accounts:

<br>

<h3 class="text-end"><b>@by.koga</b>,<br>for my traditional and digital drawings</h3>

### &

<h3 class="text-start"><b>@dsgn.koga</b>,<br>for my design / typographic art</h3>

## i also have a twitter account just for my current projects:

<br>

<h3 class="text-end">it is called<br><b>@by_koga,</b><br></h3>

<h3 class="text-start">and i use it to share<br><b>my games, my drawings, etc...</b></h3>

---

# **oh,**

## i also have a website for my webdesign ideas!

<br>

##### skills

### have you ever heard the quote:

<h1 class="m-0 p-0">“</h1>

<h2 class="text-start">jack of all trades,</h2>

<h2 class="text-end"><b>master of none?</b></h2>

<h1 class="m-0 p-0 plt-4">”</h1>

#### while spreading yourself too thin isn't a good idea, i believe that a well-rounded arsenal of abilities allows people to think for themselves, discover for themselves, and decide for themselves

---

## specialization is the norm nowadays!

---

#### this has led to an increase in ignorance (or the perception of it)

#### **i've always strove to be a flexible person.** someone who can understand a multitude of topics, do a little bit of everything, and overall, always be of help

---

### here's a list of my skills / hobbies (things i've spent a decent time practicing).

### they're categorized by the type of intelligence / experience* required:

<span class="h4"><b>traditional art</b></span> - i spent years studying traditional art in an art studio near my house, focusing on paper media and architecture subjects mostly. early 2020 i started tackling human anatomy, drawing poses, faces, etc.

- drawing (pencil, ink pen)
- coloring (colored pencil)
- painting (oil paint, guache, watercolor)

<br>

<span class="h4"><b>digital art</b></span> - i started using digital media for my drawings at the start of the pandemic (early 2020). since then, i've already learned to use multiple programs, publishing several artworks on my instagram

- clip studio paint (my personal preference)
- krita (first program i've used)

<span class="h4"><b>pixel art</b></span> - although pixel art is technically digital art, i prefer to separate it as the techniques and tools used are very different. i use pixel art mostly for my games

- aseprite (the best tool, hands down)
- GIMP

<span class="h4"><b>design / typography</b></span> - again, technically digital art. design / typography is mostly about branding and vector art. the tools, purpose, and techniques are all different, so it deserves its own section

- figma (very useful for poster-like content)
- inkscape (the best free software for vectors that i know)

<span class="h4"><b>photography</b></span> - i've always been a fan of photography, studying composition, color theory, and more since young. (it's important to notice the difference between simply taking photos and being a photographer)

- my personal instagram @real.koga used to be my photo gallery, although i've archived the photos
