##### **introduction**

<h4 class="text-start">hey there! i'm</h4>

<h1 class="text-start">andré</h1>
<h1 class="text-end">koga</h1>

#### a 19yr old Brazilian startup founder, game developer, web designer, artist, sports lover, scientific Olympiads medalist, and owner of two dogs.

---

#### nice to meet you!

#### (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)

##### **education**

## in 2021 i was accepted into

# six!

## international universities, as follows:

---

1. **Studies in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics** - University of Toronto, Mississauga
2. **Co-op Computer Science** - University of Toronto, Scarborough
3. **Studies in Computer Science at the Faculty of Arts and Science** - University of Toronto, Innis College
4. **Bachelor of Applied Science Program** - University of British Columbia
5. **Computer Science in the College of Science at West Lafayette** - Purdue University
6. **Major at Computer Science** - Georgia Institute of Technology

---

## as you can see, i'm good at math, physics, computer science...

###### ...or just stem, in general (✿◡‿◡)

---

### but my skills didn't come from nowhere!

### to be accepted by these universities, i had to work hard:

---

- during my middle school (2014 - 2017) at **Colégio Mater Amabilis** i was among the best students, going as far as receiving full-ride thanks to my academic performance in olympiads and exams

<br>

#### i won 35 medals from scientific Olympiads during this period, ranging from **physics to astronomy, math, robotics, and more**

#### this includes **three!** international math Olympiads

###### (shown in the [awards](#awards) section)

<br>

- thanks to these international medals, a headhunter from **Colégio Farias Brito**, one of the best educational institutions in Brazil, invited me to study there

<br>

#### that's how i started living by myself 2954km / 1854mi away from my family **when i was only 15yrs old**

#### the institution gave me a full-ride which included food, clothing, transportation, and even an apartment with other like-minded students!

<br>

- i then started participating in an honors class, focusing in math olympiads. in 2020, i began the process of studying for the SAT / TOEFL exams

<br>

#### my tests were rescheduled several times due to the pandemic. uncertainty was the norm as no one knew what would happen to us, students.

#### nonetheless, **i remained positive**, studying several hours per day. the hard work paid off!

---

### i scored

## **1550 / 1600**

### on the SAT and

## **111 / 120**

### on the TOEFL

---

## of course, **good scores aren't enough.**

### a good profile needs to be well-rounded!

##### leadership

### i've always been a natural leader.

<h2 class="text-end">not because i think i'm better...</h2>

<br>

<h4 class="text-center">(〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)</h4>

<br>

<h2 class="text-start">...but because i think i can bring the best out of others!</h2>

---

- i was one of the three founders of Nery, a medical startup (2020). It all started after we got **2nd place** in the MIT Hackmed Brasil Competition. The prize was used to support the project! I helped as the CTO, using my UI/UX expertise

#### although i was the youngest of the group - by far - i managed to find my role and help my co-founders during the initial steps

<p class="text-end">...unfortunately, we stopped due to COVID issues <b>＞︿＜</b></p>

---

- i am the co-founder of Good Luck Collective as well, a game dev group (2021)

#### i help with the coding, art, and design of the games

#### i act as the bridge between the programmers and the artists, helping with the development and ensuring the flow isn't interrupted during game projects

#### we've already won a game-jam!

---

- i was the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of Dupla, a headhunting startup (2021). i developed the website (design included!), took care of the marketing, and managed the social media content

#### we managed, in such a short period, to gather a lot of followers

#### investors quickly became interested in helping us!

<p class="text-end">this one i left to pursue my own path! it was worth it (✿◡‿◡)</p>

---

- as you know, i also have my personal projects

<br>

## i publish stuff i make on two instagram accounts:

<br>

<h3 class="text-end"><b>@by.koga</b>,<br>for my traditional and digital drawings</h3>

### &

<h3 class="text-start"><b>@dsgn.koga</b>,<br>for my design / typographic art</h3>

---

## i also have a twitter account just for my current projects:

<br>

<h3 class="text-end">it is called<br><b>@by_koga,</b><br></h3>

<h3 class="text-start">and i use it to share<br><b>my games, my drawings, etc...</b></h3>

---

# **oh,**

## how could i forget!

## i also have a website for my webdesign ideas!

<br>

<h3 class="text-end">it is called <a href="bykoga.com"><b>by.koga</b></a>, and...</h3>

<h3 class="text-start">...wait a second, you already know this</h3>

## ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

##### community

### talking about leadership,

<br>

## i was the **vice-president of NOIC**, an education NGO

###### (2018 - 2020)

---

#### NOIC is the biggest education NGO made by students in Brazil!

#### it has thousands and thousands of posts about several subjects, helping **students in need** to study for Olympiads.

#### i supervised over 40 members! not only that, i was responsible for the rebranding and overhaul of the platform.

---

## the monthly views **doubled** after my redesign!

### here are some other stats:

---

### the platform has over

# **3M**

## million views,

# **2.5k**

## posts,

# **80**

## different Olympiads,

# **10k**

## followers in different medias,

# **70**

## members & collaborators,

## and

# **5**

## years of a rich history!

###### (stats from 17/11/2021)

##### skills

### have you ever heard the quote:

<h1 class="m-0 p-0">“</h1>

<h2 class="text-start">jack of all trades,</h2>

<h2 class="text-end"><b>master of none?</b></h2>

<h1 class="m-0 p-0 plt-4">”</h1>

#### while spreading yourself too thin isn't a good idea, i believe that a well-rounded arsenal of abilities allows people to think for themselves, discover for themselves, and decide for themselves

---

## nowadays, people prefer to focus on just a few subjects

---

#### this has led to an increase in ignorance (or the perception of it)

#### **i've always strove to be a flexible person.** someone who can understand a multitude of topics, do a little bit of everything, and overall, always be of help

---

### here's a list of my skills / hobbies (things i've spent a decent time practicing).

### they're categorized by the type of intelligence / experience* required:

<p class="text-end">*gardner's theory of multiple intelligences</p>

---

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#C8564E">bodily-kinesthetic</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>coordinating your mind with your body</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>baseball</b></span> - this was the first sport i've ever experienced. i was around 6yrs old when i started, training for around 5yrs. i was very young, so there wasn't that spark of competitiveness inside me yet. still, baseball was essential for me to develop the strength in my right arm and overall coordination

- i've won a couple of trophies and medals (~5 trophies, ~15 medals. i can't remember correctly)

<span class="h4"><b>handball</b></span> - the sport that i play the best. i started right after i stopped playing baseball, and only stopped recently thanks to COVID. in 2021 i was going to be the captain of the team of my high school...

- i've won a couple of medals and tournaments!

<span class="h4"><b>volleyball</b></span> - used to be my favorite sport during 8th and 9th grade. considering i'm very short, it was always fun to jump above everyone else and be able to smash the ball. together with my speed and coordination, i've already partaken in all roles of the team (libero as well, of course)

<span class="h4"><b>table-tennis</b></span> - the sport that i spend the most time playing nowadays. i train around 2 hours per week (not much, honestly). i started in late 2020, and i've improved decently in one year

<span class="h4"><b>tennis</b></span> - another sport that i play nowadays. honestly, i don't enjoy tennis that much, but that's probably just because i suck at it

<span class="h4"><b>judo</b></span> - i plan to start judo classes really soon!

<span class="h4"><b>ambidextrousness</b></span> - fun fact: i'm ambidextrous! i am naturally left-handed, but nowadays i can use both arms pretty effectively. it's all thanks to two factors. firstly, my baseball 先生 ("sensei", which means teacher in japanese), for some reason, taught me to throw the ball with my right arm. because baseball was my first sport, i've learned since young to throw with my right, but never with my left. the second reason is that, when i was young, i broke my left arm days before some school exams. i then decided to learn how to write with my right arm, so i could take the tests nonetheless. it worked pretty well!

- i use my left arm for fine movement. this includes writing, painting, drawing (anything artistic), holding the fork, etc.
- i use my right arm for tasks that require strength, such as most sports
- (these rules don't always apply. i play table tennis with my left, use the skateboard with my left, mouse and scissors with my right, etc.)

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#D86492">linguistic</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>finding the right words to express what you mean</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>writing skills</b></span> - i've always been pretty decent at writing. since young teachers have complimented my skills. nowadays, whenever i need to release stress, writing is my first option (i write the best when i'm emotionally disturbed, idk)

- i've written a ton of poems and chronicles
- specially, i'm currently writing an adventure game "thoughts that pass by". it has a complex storyline!

<span class="h4"><b>reading</b></span> - i've been incentivated to read since young by my parents. for that reason, i've always been keen on books, specially the classical ones. this isn't a "skill" exactly, mostly just a hobby. i don't speed read, i just enjoy books

- i really like "Sapiens" and the Percy Jackson series

<span class="h4"><b>languages</b></span> - one of my lifetime goals is to know at least 5 languages fluently. slowly but surely i'm getting there! thanks to the internet, it isn't hard to learn for free / alone

- **portuguese**, fluent (mother language, nothing special really)
- **english**, fluent (i've been studying english since around 10yrs old. nowadays i can think in english like it is my mother language)
- **japanese**, beginner (i'm currently studying japanese! hopefully i'll be advanced in a year or two, let's see how it goes. i might even translate this website to japanese if possible)
- **spanish**, beginner (i used to have spanish classes when i was younger, so i know a little bit. moreover, portuguese and spanish have a lot in common, so it isn't impossible to understand sentences half of the time)
- **toki pona**, beginner (...just search about toki pona. it is a pretty cool language. i don't know if i'll ever memorize every word in it, but i know a few already)

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#66397D">musical</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>discerning sounds, their pitch, tone, rhythm, and timbre</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>musical composition</b></span> - i occasionally compose music for my games. granted, the music isn't impressive. still, it's something that i <b>can</b> do, if necessary

<span class="h4"><b>violin</b></span> - i plan to start violin classes really soon, let's see how it goes!

---

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#3870A5">interpersonal</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>sensing people's feelings and motives</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>leadership</b></span> - this isn't a hobby, just a personal skill. as i've previously mentioned, i am naturally attracted towards leadership. i'm not sure why, but people also tend to put me in a leader spot implicitly

<span class="h4"><b>coaching</b></span> - recently i've been coaching some people on Overwatch, a competitive 6v6 game that i play a lot. coaching is about helping and understanding others while ensuring your point is correctly understood. it is very fun!

---

###### <span class="px-1" style="background-color:#EABF62">intrapersonal</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>understanding yourself, what you feel, and what you want</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>meditation</b></span> - whenever i need to calm down and focus i meditate. it is such a simple yet effective tool for calming down! i've yet to try long periods such as over an hour. i'll do it someday

<span class="h4"><b>"diary"</b></span> - although i don't exactly have a diary, i do use an app called 1SE. it allows me to record one second of footage per day as a way of keeping track of the year. it is very fun!

---

###### <span class="px-1" style="background-color:#7FD4D5">logical-mathematical</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>quantifying things, making hypotheses and proving them</i></p>

<span class="h4"><b>game dev</b></span> - i started coding thanks to minecraft's coding blocks update in late 2012. soon after i was already trying to code my own games in drag 'n drop engines. unsatisfied, i eventually gathered courage to learn C# and face the steep learning curve of Unity. self taught, i've published a couple of games on itch.io and google play by myself, as well as with my game dev group

- currently working on a big game called **thoughts that pass by**. it'll be published on steam, google play, itch.io, and more?

<span class="h4"><b>web dev</b></span> - while learning coding in general, i eventually stumbled upon web tools - JS, CSS, HTML, and more. i've always wanted to create my own website, and so i started learning all about these different frameworks and technologies. 

- my first free website called Young Minds was my first experience with web development. It was made with Blogger, and it was simply a personal blog
- my next project was called The Thought Compiler, a website that had the purpose of showing my web dev / web design skills. it had a short life, however, as i soon realized that i didn't want to use Wordpress
- my current project, by.koga, is what you see in front of your eyes. nowadays i prefer a more raw, techy experience, using tools such as Hugo, terminal tools, and Github Pages.
- i've also designed three other websites: NOIC, Dupla, and Nery. i already mentioned them up somewhere, go take a look

<span class="h4"><b>coding</b></span> - just coding information in general

- i started learning coding thanks to codecademy (thank you!) when i was 12yrs old
- i've already used C, C++, C#, JS, Python, PHP, Ruby, and more for my projects

<span class="h4"><b>puzzle-solving</b></span> - while everyone requires and uses puzzle-solving skills daily, it's a whole different matter to learn about techniques to solve problems and challange yourself daily with mind boggling conundrums

- i started tackling puzzles with my father when i was just a little kid and the DSi launched. by playing Professor Layton i became enthralled with the feeling of cogs turning inside my brain. the "aha!" moments defined me forever
- nowadays i create puzzles myself, challenging friends and online followers. sometimes i even get challenges back

<span class="h4"><b>scientific Olympiads</b></span> - as an extension of puzzle-solving, scientific Olympiads offered me a more competitive feeling of solving problems. they pretty much defined my entire school trajectory, leading me to change schools and find multiple opportunities of growth

- all of the awards are in the [awards](#awards) section
- as a curiosity, if you add the scientific medals that me and my siblings have earned, it currently surpasses one hundred!

<span class="h4"><b>economy</b></span> - i started learning about finances, economy, and stock market just recently (late 2021). this is mostly a hobby of mine, not exactly a skill

- i have yet to gain actual money (￣_￣|||)

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#437E49">spatial</span>

<p class="text-end"><i>visualizing the world in 3D</i></p>

<br>

<span class="h4"><b>traditional art</b></span> - i spent 5 years studying traditional art in an art studio near my house, focusing on paper media and architecture subjects mostly. early 2020 i started tackling human anatomy, drawing poses, faces, etc.

- drawing (pencil, ink pen)
- coloring (colored pencil)
- painting (oil paint, guache, watercolor)

<br>

<span class="h4"><b>digital art</b></span> - i started using digital media for my drawings at the start of the pandemic (early 2020). since then, i've already learned to use multiple programs, publishing several artworks on my instagram

- clip studio paint (my personal preference)
- krita (first program i've used)

<span class="h4"><b>pixel art</b></span> - although pixel art is technically digital art, i prefer to separate it as the techniques and tools used are very different. i use pixel art mostly for my games

- aseprite (the best tool, hands down)
- GIMP

<span class="h4"><b>design / typography</b></span> - again, technically digital art. design / typography is mostly about branding and vector art. the tools, purpose, and techniques are all different, so it deserves its own section

- figma (very useful for poster-like content)
- inkscape (the best free software for vectors that i know)

<span class="h4"><b>photography</b></span> - i've always been a fan of photography, studying composition, color theory, and more since young (it's important to notice the difference between simply taking photos and being a photographer). i have this routine of taking a short video everyday

- my personal instagram @real.koga used to be my photo gallery, although i've archived the photos

---

###### <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:gray">other stuff</span>

<span class="h4"><b>chess</b></span> - i'm pretty mediocre in chess, although i've studied it for a while. i know the basics and some common strategies, although i'm beat by my younger brother 95% of the time

<span class="h4"><b>digital content</b></span> - i have multiple social media accounts that i try to gather followers just for the business / challenge aspect

<span class="h4"><b>video editing</b></span> - i am pretty used to Resolve Studio, a great free program for editing videos. i've used it before for personal and school projects

##### awards

## here's a list of all my scientific* awards!

<p class="text-center">they're classified between <span class="px-1" style="background-color:#FFEC85"><b>gold</b></span>, <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#7A889B"><b>silver</b></span>, <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#C8564E"><b>bronze</b></span>, and <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#74514F"><b>honorary mention</b></span>, as well as <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#252A4A"><b>international</b></span>, <span class="px-1 text-light" style="background-color:#3870A5"><b>national</b></span>, and <span class="px-1" style="background-color:#7FD4D5"><b>state</b></span></p>
